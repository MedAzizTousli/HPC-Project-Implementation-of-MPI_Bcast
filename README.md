# HPC Project - Implementation of MPI_Bcast
The main goal of this project is the comparison of different message-passing algorithms that depend on the number of processors and the length of the message. This repository contains the implementation of MPI_Bcast with blocking point to point communication operations using the following models: K-chain, Binary Tree and Binomial Tree. The work will show also the method we used in order to make it possible to work for any root and any message.

<h2> About </h2>
This project was carried out as part of the training of engineers at the Ecole Polytechnique de Tunisie under the "High Performance Computing" module taught in the third year.
